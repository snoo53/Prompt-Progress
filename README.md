# Prompt Progress

Turn prompts into visible progress.

Prompt Progress is a lightweight Chrome extension that adds a subtle progress system to ChatGPT.  
Each message you send contributes to visible progression, helping build momentum over time.

It does not modify conversations.  
It does not collect data.  
It simply makes engagement measurable.

## Why Prompt Progress?

When working with AI, effort can feel invisible.

Prompt Progress introduces a small, unobtrusive reinforcement loop:
- Send a message
- See progress increase
- Build consistency over time

The goal is not gamification.
It is visibility.

When progress becomes tangible, momentum becomes easier.
